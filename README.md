# Handle an incoming call to a Sinch number using Node.js

This project will run an express server and generate an ngrok URL that can be added on the Sinch dashboard application's configured callback URL.

## How to start the server and configure the sinch callback url

Use the `make` commands bellow and follow the next steps:

1. Build the docker image
2. Run a container using the built image
3. Copy the generated URL by ngrok from STDOUT to your clipboard
4. Paste it under one of your [Sinch apps](https://dashboard.sinch.com/voice/apps) callback URL settings
5. Done! You can now call any of the Sinch assigned app inbound numbers, and your server will handle the ICE callback events generated by the Sinch platform when calling them!

### Basic usage

```bash

#### Build and tag the image
